## Set Up GitHub Repository ##
The first step in our CI journey is to set up a GitHub repository to store our Python application's source code. If you already have a repository, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, let's create a new repository on GitHub by following these steps: <br> 

Go to github.com and sign in to your account.<br>
1. Click on the "+" button in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
2.Give your repository a name and an optional description.
3. Choose the appropriate visibility option based on your needs.
4. Initialize the repository with a README file.
4. Click on the "Create repository" button to create your new GitHub repository.
   
<br>Great! Now that we have our repository set up, we can move on to the next step.
